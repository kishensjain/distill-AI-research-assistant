# Distill 🔍

> Chat with anything. URLs, PDFs, Word docs, and YouTube videos — all in one place.

Distill is an AI-powered research assistant that lets you load multiple sources and have a conversation with them. Paste a URL, upload a document, or drop a YouTube link — then ask questions and get answers grounded in your content.

## Features

- 🌐 **URL ingestion** — paste any webpage URL and chat with its content
- 📄 **PDF & Word support** — upload `.pdf` and `.docx` files directly
- 🎥 **YouTube transcripts** — paste a YouTube link and chat with the video
- 🧠 **Smart chunking** — content is split into chunks and only the most relevant ones are sent to the model
- ⚡ **Streaming responses** — answers stream in real time
- 📝 **Auto summary** — sources are automatically summarised when loaded
- 💬 **Multi-turn memory** — the assistant remembers your conversation
- 🖥️ **Gradio web UI** — clean browser-based interface

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/distill.git
cd distill
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### 3. Set up your API key

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```
OLLAMA_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Or if using a different provider, update the client in `src/ui.py` accordingly.

### 4. Run the app

```bash
uv run main.py
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:7860](http://127.0.0.1:7860) in your browser.

## How It Works

1. **Ingest** — content is fetched and cleaned from your sources
2. **Chunk** — content is split into overlapping chunks of ~1000 characters
3. **Retrieve** — when you ask a question, the most relevant chunks are selected using keyword matching
4. **Generate** — selected chunks are sent to the LLM along with your question and conversation history
5. **Stream** — the response streams back in real time

This is a lightweight implementation of **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** built from scratch without any RAG framework.
